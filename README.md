## Notes

Possible additions-

* Array looping support (note that `{{foo.0}}` already works)
* Computed properties (e.g., `{{foo(bar, zing)}}`)
* Better attribute syntax (Polymer always uses `foo$="{{bar}}"`)
* Two-way attribute binding (e.g., `[[foo]]` as well as `{{foo}}`)
* Property binding (e.g., `.hidden` not `hidden=""`)
